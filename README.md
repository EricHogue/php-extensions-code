php-extensions-code
===================

The attach-library branch actually brings in the uriparser library (uriparser.sourceforge.net)
and adds a VERY simple php function from the extension to retrieve the current version of the library
It also adds a test for the version function to make sure it actually works, and adds a line to the phpinfo block for the extension
