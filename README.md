php-extensions-code
===================

The scaffolding branch is a very simple example of an extension for what will be a uriparser library wrapper
we have a .gitignore for all our junk, a simple .m4 (we'll add the .w32 version later), and simple scaffolding, along
with a single test to make sure our phpinfo is right and a simple .c file to define our module (PHP extension)
